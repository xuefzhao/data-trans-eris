Relative file path './raw_bed' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.
AmbiguousRuleException:
Rules bedtools_intersect_10X and bedtools_intersect_ill are ambiguous for the file raw_bed/inheritance_ill/115.fa_pb.ill.bed.
