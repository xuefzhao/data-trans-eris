Building DAG of jobs...
Relative file path './raw_bed' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	all
	39	extract_SV_Size
	1	extract_num_SVs

rule extract_num_SVs:
    input: ./raw_bed
    output: stats/Num_SVs.Per_Samp.stat

Touching output file stats/Num_SVs.Per_Samp.stat.
Finished job 33.

rule extract_SV_Size:
    output: stats/GMKFC34323.SV_size
